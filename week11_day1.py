# Day 2 Review Activity: My Personal Info Generator
# ----------------------------------------

print(" Welcome to the Python Review Activity!")
print("You’ll review variables, strings, numbers, and print formatting.\n")

# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Vanessa"
age = 17
favorite_color = "Purple"
favorite_number = 1

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print("upper:", first_name.upper())

# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print(len(first_name))

# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
print(f"Hello! My name is {first_name}, and my favorite color is {favorite_color}")

#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
new_age = age + favorite_number
print(f"In January 2026, I will be {new_age} years old.")

#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers
b_day = (input("When is your birthday?: "))
age1 = (int(input("How old will you be next year?: ")))
older = True
if age > age:
    print(True)
else : print(False)
print(f"Since your birthday is {b_day}, you will be {age1} next year. Are you older than me?: {older}")

# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together
